## 🤔 Why Beacon?

<br>

**Beacon** was created to connect volunteers and local communities to create a better world. We believe that by working together, we can make a positive impact on the world around us. Whether it's volunteering at a local food bank, cleaning up a park, or mentoring a child, every act of kindness makes a difference. Join us on this journey to create a brighter future for all.

It serves as a platform which connects local communities connect with volunteers. It provides a space where volunteers can search for projects and initiatives within their local community that align with their interests and skills, and allows community members to request support from volunteers for their projects.

## 💪Challenges I ran into

<ul>
  <li>I did not prepare an idea prior to the hackathon, which resulted in a lot of wasted time trying to come up with one on the spot. </li>
  <li>Since I didn't have prior experience with JavaScript and React. I was constantly jumping tutorials in an attempt to learn them quickly but that had caused more harm than good.</li>
  <li>Despite the fact that, in the end, I did come up with an idea, I tried to build something too complex which I was unfamiliar to begin with.</li>
  <li>I was procrastinating even though I could've achieved something better in the end.</li>
</ul> 

<br>


## ✍️ What I learned

<br>

<ul>
  <li>I need to stay resilient no matter what.</li>
  <li>Gain experience with tools that are required for my project but that I am unfamiliar with.</li>
  <li>If everything else fails to go as planned. Make sure to do one thing correctly to make it stand out.</li>
  <li>Set short-term goals, achieve them, and then move on to improving or developing new features.</li>
</ul>
